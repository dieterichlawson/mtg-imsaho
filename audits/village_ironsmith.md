**Oracle text source**: Oracle cache (Scryfall API) — https://scryfall.com/card/isd/168/village-ironsmith-ironfang?utm_source=api
**Type line**: `Creature — Human Werewolf` — {1}{R}, 1/1
**Oracle text**:
```
First strike
At the beginning of each upkeep, if no spells were cast last turn, transform this creature.
```
**Back face**: Ironfang — `Creature — Werewolf`, 3/1
```
First strike
At the beginning of each upkeep, if a player cast two or more spells last turn, transform this creature.
```

**Status**: PASS

### Code issues
No issues found.

- The transform pair is the set's shared werewolf mechanism, and it turns on a
  distinction the wording makes precisely:
  - front → back, "if **no spells were cast** last turn":
    `num_spells_cast_last_turn.values().sum::<u32>() == 0` — nobody cast anything.
  - back → front, "if **a player** cast two or more spells last turn":
    `.values().any(|&count| count >= 2)` — one player individually reached two,
    not the table's total.
  Summing for the second, or requiring a single caster for the first, would both
  be wrong; neither is done.
- Both are intervening-if clauses (CR 603.4), and the card overrides
  `should_trigger` through `helpers::werewolf_should_trigger`, so with the
  condition unmet nothing reaches the stack.
- That helper also refuses the trigger for a token copy, which cannot transform
  (CR 111.7) — so it does not sit on the stack with nothing to do.
- Back-face P/T comes from `dynamic_pt`, which supplies the *base* in
  `effective_power`, leaving counters and anthems to layer on top.

### What else was checked
Card data verified exact set-wide — cost, card types, supertypes, subtypes, P/T,
oracle text, keywords on both faces, flashback cost, and trigger kinds against
the oracle phrasing (see `ISD_AUDIT_PROGRESS.md`). Step 9 anti-patterns: clean.

### Test coverage
`werewolf_cards.rs` (29 tests over the family), `intervening_if.rs` (the spell-count condition), `transform_dfc.rs` (CR 712 face characteristics).

### Code issues
No issues found.

- The flip conditions are the shared `werewolf_should_trigger` /
  `werewolf_should_transform` helpers — one implementation of "if no spells were
  cast last turn" and "if a player cast two or more spells last turn" for the
  whole family: PASS
- CR 603.4: both are intervening-ifs, checked when the trigger would go on the
  stack *and* again on resolution: PASS
- "At the beginning of **each** upkeep" — `TriggerScope::Each`, so it fires on
  the opponent's turn too: PASS
- Each face's P/T, keywords and subtypes were checked against the fetched oracle
  face by face, not against Scryfall's merged `Keywords` list — which is the trap
  here, since that list names keywords the front face does not have: PASS
- First strike is on **both** faces (1/1 front, 3/1 back), unlike its siblings
  where the keyword is back-face only: PASS

### What else was checked
Card data verified exact set-wide — cost, card types, supertypes, subtypes, P/T,
oracle text, keywords on both faces, flashback cost, and trigger kinds against
the oracle phrasing (see `ISD_AUDIT_PROGRESS.md`). Step 9 anti-patterns: clean.

### Test coverage
- The flip and both faces' first strike: `werewolf_cards.rs`
- The back face's size: `cards_transforming_permanents.rs:every_transformed_dfc_is_its_back_faces_printed_size`
