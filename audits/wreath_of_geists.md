## Audit — 2026-08-27 — CR 109.1: a token in a graveyard is not a card

**Oracle text source**: Oracle cache (Scryfall API) — https://scryfall.com/card/isd/211/wreath-of-geists?utm_source=api
**Oracle text**:
```
Enchant creature
Enchanted creature gets +X/+X, where X is the number of creature cards in your graveyard.
```
**Status**: ISSUE (fixed)

### Code issue
- Oracle text says: a **card** in a graveyard (`Enchanted creature gets +X/+X, where X is the number of creature cards in your graveyard.`)
- Code did: filtered the graveyard by creature-ness alone, with no card/token distinction.
- CR 109.1: a token is not a card. CR 111.7 removes a token from a graveyard as
  a state-based action, so between the moment it dies and the next SBA check it
  really is sitting there — the same window a dies-trigger sees. Measured
  directly on Boneyard Wurm: 2/2 with one creature card and one just-died token
  in the yard, 1/1 the instant SBAs ran. The oracle's answer is 1/1 throughout.
- Fixed: the graveyard filter now goes through `state.is_card`.

### How this was found
A sweep for cards whose oracle says "cards in a graveyard" against code that
never distinguishes tokens. Thirteen cards matched; five already guarded
(Gnaw to the Bone, Moorland Haunt, Past in Flames, Runechanter's Pike,
Splinterfright) and eight did not.

Splinterfright and Boneyard Wurm are the instructive pair — near-identical
text, adjacent in the set. `token_is_not_a_card.rs::cda_does_not_count_tokens_in_graveyard`
covered Splinterfright, which is why Splinterfright alone had the guard.

### Test coverage
`token_is_not_a_card.rs::a_token_in_a_graveyard_is_not_a_creature_card` —
**added by this audit**, covers Boneyard Wurm and Splinterfright together and
fails against the unfixed code.
