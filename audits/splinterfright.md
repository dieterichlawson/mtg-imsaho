## Audit — 2026-08-27 — CR 603.2 trigger scope

**Oracle text source**: Oracle cache (Scryfall API) — https://scryfall.com/card/isd/205/splinterfright?utm_source=api
**Type line**: `Creature — Elemental` — {2}{G}, */*
**Oracle text**:
```
Trample
Splinterfright's power and toughness are each equal to the number of creature cards in your graveyard.
At the beginning of your upkeep, mill two cards. (Put the top two cards of your library into your graveyard.)
```

**Status**: ISSUE (fixed) — duplication, not a rules defect

### Code issue
- Oracle text says the trigger happens at **your** upkeep / **your** end step.
- Code did: declared `step_trigger_scope` → `TriggerScope::Your`, which is
  correct and sufficient, and then re-derived the same thing inside the handler
  as `state.active_player != controller`.
- The engine's gate is not taken on trust: `your_upkeep_scope.rs` sweeps the
  registry for every card with a controller-scoped step trigger and checks both
  directions — fires on the controller's step, silent on the opponent's. The
  handler check was provably dead.
- Fixed: removed, with a comment saying where the scoping actually lives.


### What else was checked
- Card data verified exact set-wide (see `ISD_AUDIT_PROGRESS.md`): cost, types,
  subtypes, supertypes, P/T, oracle text, keywords on both faces, flashback
  cost, and trigger kinds against the oracle phrasing.
- Step 9 anti-patterns: clean after this change.

### Test coverage
`your_upkeep_scope.rs::a_your_step_trigger_fires_on_its_controllers_step_and_no_one_elses`
covers this card by registry sweep, in both directions.
