# Audit: Stony Silence

## Oracle (Scryfall)
- **Name:** Stony Silence
- **Cost:** {1}{W}
- **Type:** Enchantment
- **Oracle:** Activated abilities of artifacts can't be activated.
- **P/T:** N/A

## Implementation: `mtg-engine/src/cards/stony_silence.rs`
- **Name:** Stony Silence ✅
- **Cost:** {1}{W} ✅
- **Type:** Enchantment ✅
- **Oracle text:** matches ✅

### Issue
- **NOT IMPLEMENTED:** The card's static ability (preventing activation of artifact abilities) is not enforced by the engine. The code comments explicitly document this as a known limitation. The card exists for deck building and oracle text purposes only.

## Verdict: ISSUE -- static ability not enforced (documented known limitation)
