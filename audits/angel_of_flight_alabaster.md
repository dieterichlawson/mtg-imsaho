## Audit — 2026-08-27 — CR 603.2 trigger scope

**Oracle text source**: Oracle cache (Scryfall API) — https://scryfall.com/card/isd/2/angel-of-flight-alabaster?utm_source=api
**Type line**: `Creature — Angel` — {4}{W}, 4/4
**Oracle text**:
```
Flying
At the beginning of your upkeep, return target Spirit card from your graveyard to your hand.
```

**Status**: ISSUE (fixed) — duplication, not a rules defect

### Code issue
- Oracle text says the trigger happens at **your** upkeep / **your** end step.
- Code did: declared `step_trigger_scope` → `TriggerScope::Your`, which is
  correct and sufficient, and then re-derived the same thing inside the handler
  as `state.active_player != controller`.
- The engine's gate is not taken on trust: `your_upkeep_scope.rs` sweeps the
  registry for every card with a controller-scoped step trigger and checks both
  directions — fires on the controller's step, silent on the opponent's. The
  handler check was provably dead.
- Fixed: removed, with a comment saying where the scoping actually lives.
Additionally, the handler opened with a `get_object(self_id)` match that
returned early when the source was gone. That never fired — a permanent in a
graveyard still resolves `get_object` — but CR 113.7a means the ability owes
nothing to its source and the effect only needs its target, so the lookup was
removed as well.

### What else was checked
- Card data verified exact set-wide (see `ISD_AUDIT_PROGRESS.md`): cost, types,
  subtypes, supertypes, P/T, oracle text, keywords on both faces, flashback
  cost, and trigger kinds against the oracle phrasing.
- Step 9 anti-patterns: clean after this change.

### Test coverage
`your_upkeep_scope.rs::a_your_step_trigger_fires_on_its_controllers_step_and_no_one_elses`
covers this card by registry sweep, in both directions.
